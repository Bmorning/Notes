* #### In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive.
* Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and`$`or`_`, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

* When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be `NaN` which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

* In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash \(\\) in front of the quote.
